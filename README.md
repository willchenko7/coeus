# Coeus

Coeus is designed to answer questions by combining state of the art large language models with efficient math solvers and databases. In this way Coeus can utilize the magical reasoning of LLM's while providing the grounding effect of exact solutions. Notably, Coeus can theoretically use this framework to solve problems that are currently beyond the reach of human knowledge.

Coeus is named after the Greek Titan, who was born of Uranus (sky) and Gaia (earth) and his name translates to "intelligence." This project is inspired by Coeus because we see this project as the development of pure intelligence by combining LLM's (the sky) and math (the ground).
