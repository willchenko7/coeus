Goal: execute a single step in the solving plan.

Input:
    problem: a string containing a problem statement

Output:
    answer: a string containing the answer to the problem statement

Example:
    problem = 'Solve for radius_of_sphere: volume_of_sphere=radius_of_sphere*3.14'
    
    answer = 'radius_of_sphere = volume_of_sphere/3.14'
